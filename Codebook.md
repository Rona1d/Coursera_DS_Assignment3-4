- Study design

This dataset contains aggregated data on research of human activity recognition using smartphones 

Original description of the reserach is available through:

In the original study, the data was seperated into a test and training set. This data is composed out of both the test and training data. 

The variables in this dataset come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ in the original study. The time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. The acceleration signal was separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ). 
The body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 
Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

A set of variables were estimated from these signals. The set for this specific dataset consists of: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency

This dataset also contains additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample, used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean

All of the variables within this dataset are the means of these original variables by subject and activity.
